4. Understand the theory behind naïve Bayes classifiers.
5. Understand the difference between Likelihood, prior probability and marginal likelihood. 
6. Learn how to work with unbalanced dataset.
7. Train a Naïve Bayes classifier model using scikit learn.
8. Develop a function in python and apply it to pandas data frame
